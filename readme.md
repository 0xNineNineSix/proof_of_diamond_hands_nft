# Proof of Diamond Hands - NFT version

Messing around with Vyper and ETH smart contracts

Deposit ETH, and it gets locked until ETH hits a certain price, and you mint a transferrable NFT

Swapped with wSTETH in the background so you earn interest on it.

Swapped back to ETH with you withdrawal

Non-upgradeable contract. The only admin function is to "emergency withdrawal" funds back to the depositor address
